## Build on Linux

Seems there is not an opencv release for linux so need to build it.  See below

Note:  May help to turn opencv-dnn option off if not needed, some systems have trouble compiling this

Need to make sure Ant is installed for Java wrappers

May also help to turn 'WITH_OPEN_JPEG' off.
