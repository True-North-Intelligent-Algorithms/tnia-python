# Introduction to Data Analysis

## Course Goals

1.  Learn how to install and use modern development tools for Python such as git, Visual Studio Code, and Mamba.
2.  Learn the basics of the Python programming language.
3.  Learn how to use Python packages such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and others to analyze data.
4.  Learn how to learn what you don't know (or forget) quickly by using LLMs such as Chat GPT and/or internet searches.

## Text book

We don't follow any specific text book chapter by chapter.  Instead we focus on real world data analysis challenges that are of interest to the students.  That being said we recommend the following two text books as a good source of complimentary material. 

John Zelle = Python Programming - An Introduction to Computer Science
Ivan Idris - Python Data Analysis

## FAQs

1.  Why do I have to install all these tools?  I saw another course where you program right in the browser.  Let's do that. 

That is also a good way to learn, but it is hard to archive, share, and re-use code that you created in a browser.  It is better to learn about source control, packages, environments and IDEs right from the beginning even if it is harder to get started.
