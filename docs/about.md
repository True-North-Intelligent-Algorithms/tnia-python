Brian is a consultant who works on image analysis problems. He is a contributor to the [ImageJ Ops](/libs/imagej-ops) project.

## What is Brian working on 

### Consulting

I consult mainly with startups and small businesses, in the biomed space, who are looking to commercialize academic research. Often times they have pre-existing matlab and other legacy code that needs to be converted to a user-friendly app, such as an ImageJ-plugin. Recent projects have included:

1.  **Deconvolution**
2.  **Bio-image analysis and feature detection**
3.  **Single particle localization**
4.  **Machine learning**
5.  **Image analysis for clinical trials and product validation**

### ImageJ

I have contributed to the following projects

1.  **ImageJ Ops**
2.  **ImageJ Scripting**
3.  **ImageJ ITK**

Efforts I am interested in, and would like to contribute to in the future

1.  **High performance and GPU computing**
2.  **Machine learning and deep learning for ImageJ**
3.  **Matlab bridge**
