## Consulting

I consult mainly with startups and small businesses, in the biomed space, who are looking to commercialize academic research. Often times they have pre-existing matlab and other legacy code that needs to be converted to a user-friendly app, such as an ImageJ-plugin. Recent projects have included:

1.  **Deconvolution**
2.  **Java wrappers to c++ code**
2.  **Bio-image analysis and feature detection**
3.  **Single particle localization**
4.  **Deep learning segmentation and restoration**
5.  **Image analysis for clinical trials and product validation**

## Open source contributions

I have contributed to the following open source projects

1.  **ImageJ Ops**
2.  **ImageJ Scripting**
3.  **ImageJ ITK**
4.  **CLIJ**
5.  **Clesperanto**
