    "## A way to map numpy to cupy\n",
    "\n",
    "[CuPy](https://cupy.dev/) is a NumPy/SciPy-compatible Library for GPU-accelerated Computing with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been experimenting with ways to quickly convert numpy code to cupy and this notebook shows a potential approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cavaets\n",
    "\n",
    "I program in a lot of languages, an expert in none, so I am possibly missing an already existing pattern or utility to do this.  Also mapping numpy to cupy would probably cause a bunch of bugs if you did it all over the place in an existing code base.  For new code you might even consider using an alias for np then mapping cupy or numpy to it depending on whether cupy is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said this technique might be useful if you have small well contained scripts, notebook cells or functions and want to quickly see if cupy will accelerate performance. "
