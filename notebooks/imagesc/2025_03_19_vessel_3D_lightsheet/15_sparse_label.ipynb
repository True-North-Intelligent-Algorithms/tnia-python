    "## Use Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-DL to load and label images\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook starts up Napari-Easy-Augment-Batch-DL and points it to our project directory.  At the beginning of a project this directory is simply the location of our collection of images.  For the light sheet vessel example it will be the 2D slices we extracted and saved in the ```10_generate_training_slices``` notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of how ```napari-easy-augment-batch-dl``` is used to load and label images, and how data should be organized see [here](https://true-north-intelligent-algorithms.github.io/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl/load_and_label/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparse labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will use sparse labeling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse Labeling**:  Not every pixel has to be labeled.  However some background needs to be labeled to differentiate between background pixels and unlabeled pixels.  For example if there were 2 foreground classes use label 1 for background, 2 for \"class 1\", and 3 for \"class 2\".  Unlabeled pixels (0) will be ignored. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dense Labeling**:  Every foreground pixel needs to be labeled however background does not need to be labeled.  If there were 2 foreground classes, use 1 for \"class 1\", 2 for \"class 2\" and then the remaining pixels (0) will be treated as background. "
