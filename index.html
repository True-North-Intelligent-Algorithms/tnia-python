<p>This project started as a means for me to test ideas and try out bleeding edge python libraries. As the number of experiments grew I started organizing things into packages. The library is still in the very early stages of development, and is still lacking documentation, however it's at the point where I find it useful for prototyping bio-image processing protocols.

For now, the user-base of the library is likely only people I am working with directly, or discussing image processing problems with online. The helper functions make it quicker for me to provide examples of image processing issues I have questions about, and to also provide examples when I am answering a question.

In the coming months (years) I plan to keep iterating on the library and making it more usable. Please reach out to me if you have any questions.
